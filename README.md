Yes, that is the Big Boss mascot from [Giant Robot](https://www.giantrobot.com/) on a post-it note. I made 
a series of them for the annual Post-It show in 2019. The figure was first modelled using [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) 2.8 
then I exported individual OBJ files for the head, body, arms and legs and unfolded them using [Pepakura Designer](https://tamasoft.co.jp/pepakura-en/). Pepakura allowed me to export the SVG files that I used for cutting and scoring the tiny
paper pieces with a laser cutter. Final assembly was done by hand using tweezers, toothpicks, archival safe PVA glue and lots
of patience. 

Here I'm sharing the files you can use to create something similar. I'm including the 3D models, pepakura files (which you can view using the free Pepakura Viewer Software) and PDF and SVG files that you can use to scale the design since I don't expect anyone else to be as crazy as me and make a tiny figure again. 

You can explore the folders and download the files you need or you can grab them here by right clicking and selecting "save as".
