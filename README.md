Yes, that is the Big Boss mascot from [Giant Robot](https://www.giantrobot.com/) on a post-it note. I made 
a series of them for the annual Post-It show in 2019. The figure was first modelled using [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) 2.8 
then I exported individual OBJ files for the head, body, arms and legs and unfolded them using [Pepakura Designer](https://tamasoft.co.jp/pepakura-en/). Pepakura allowed me to export the SVG files that I used for cutting and scoring the tiny
paper pieces with a laser cutter. Final assembly was done by hand using tweezers, toothpicks, archival safe PVA glue and lots
of patience. 

Here I'm sharing the files you can use to create something similar. I'm including the 3D models, pepakura files (which you can view using the free Pepakura Viewer Software) and PDF and SVG files that you can use to scale the design since I don't expect anyone else to be as crazy as me and make a tiny figure again. 

You can explore the repository folders and download the files you need or you can grab them here by right clicking the links below and selecting "save link as".

**3d Models**

https://github.com/wolfcatworkshop/giant-robot-papercraft/blob/master/3D-models/bigBoss-all.blend

* Blender file with all the parts: [bigBoss-all.blend](https://github.com/wolfcatworkshop/giant-robot-papercraft/blob/master/3D-models/bigBoss-all.blend)
* Head: [bigBoss-head.obj](https://github.com/wolfcatworkshop/giant-robot-papercraft/blob/master/3D-models/bigBoss-head.obj)
* Body: [bigBoss-body.obj](https://github.com/wolfcatworkshop/giant-robot-papercraft/blob/master/3D-models/bigBoss-body.obj)
* Arm: [bigBoss-arm.obj](https://github.com/wolfcatworkshop/giant-robot-papercraft/blob/master/3D-models/bigBoss-arm.obj)
* Foot: [bigBoss-foot.obj](https://github.com/wolfcatworkshop/giant-robot-papercraft/blob/master/3D-models/bigBoss-foot.obj)


**Pepakura Files**

Note: there is no difference between right and left when it comes to arms and feet. They are identical so make two of each. If you don't have Pepakura Designer and you are just printing your own using the PDF file below you can use Pepakura Viewer to help you with the assembly. 

* Head: [bigBoss-head.pdo](https://github.com/wolfcatworkshop/giant-robot-papercraft/blob/master/pepakura-files/bigBoss-head.pdo)
* Body: [bigBoss-body.pdo](https://github.com/wolfcatworkshop/giant-robot-papercraft/blob/master/pepakura-files/bigBoss-body.pdo)
* Arm: [bigBoss-arm.pdo](https://github.com/wolfcatworkshop/giant-robot-papercraft/blob/master/pepakura-files/bigBoss-arm.pdo)
* Foot: [bigBoss-foot.pdo](https://github.com/wolfcatworkshop/giant-robot-papercraft/blob/master/pepakura-files/bigBoss-foot.pdo)


**PDF and SVG files for printing or cutting**

Note: I'm sharing this with the same dimensions I used, but you can use your favorite vector editing program to scale everything to a more human size if you need it. Fold lines are blue and cut lines are black.

Big thanks to [Eric Nakamura](https://www.instagram.com/giantrobot/) for letting me use his design.
Happy making!
